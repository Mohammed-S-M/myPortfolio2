      <article>
        I was born and raised in Baghdad, Iraq. I lived my childhood and teenage
        years in my country until I became 18, then moved into a neighboring
        country called Jordan. After a few years, I moved into the United States
        of America when I was 21 years old.

        Since I was a child, I have loved computers and have always wondered how
        this incredible machine works in hardware and software. It was magical
        for me. Looking at the screen makes me happy as I keep wondering how
        this thing works. When I became a teenager, my parents bought me my
        first computer, and that was the starting point of experiencing what was
        that magical machine all about. I started to experiment on the software
        part and the hardware. Start to learn how to format the PC and install
        the Windows operating system. Experimenting on many software
        applications from Photoshop to Microsoft office, it was a world of
        unlimited possibilities. Also, I used to save all the money my parents
        used to give me to upgrade my hardware. In other words, the computer was
        my life and still.

        However, since I came to the US, the world of possibilities was open for
        me to learn how this remarkable machine works, so I decided to pursue a
        computer science major. Since I started learning about computers in deep
        learning, I realized my love for coding started growing as I learned
        Java, C, and C++. However, that was not enough for me, and I wanted to
        see every possible coding path to choose where I wanted to be. After
        deep searching online, I fell in love with web development. So I decided
        to be a self-learner in the learning path to be a web developer, and I
        love every step of the way. Web development is a vast world, and there
        are no limits to learning in this field.
